Without being able to compare two values, there is no way to identify when a base case, *unit*, is reached. *lengthL* and *reverseL* rely upon this in their recursion."

This choice is arbitrary in that the **Integer** instance could likely have been written so that the two types have the same direction, though I am not entirely sure how to do it purely arithmetically. Additionally note, that since *zero* is defined as the monoidal unit, it behaves more similarly to *`[]`* than it does to the actual number 0."
