##Pandemic: A peptide symphony in A Major.##

Pandemic is a composition produced from the cDNA sequence for covid-19.
Each peptide in the sequence determines a melody by sending each amino acid
to a note in a 20 tone system. Acids are ordered by their abundance across
all peptides and similarly the intervals are ordered by their abundance wrt
harmonics on a string. The most common acid then maps to the tonic tone, the
second most to the 5th (closest approximation in a 20 tone system), etc...


Since the codons carry a bit more information than simply which amino acid
they code for (a triple of bases), this additional information is used to
determine additional qualities for a given note. The 2nd base determines
the "epoch" or the time alloted for a given note to express, while the 3rd
base determines how long the note expresses. For instance, the codons CGG
and AGA both code for the acid Arginine. The epoch value "G" determines a
half notes worth a space for the note to express. In the CGG case, that note
express for the full time. In the AGA case, "A" corresponds to an eigth note
and so the note expresses for the duration of an eighth note and then is
followed by a dotted quarter note rest. If the 3rd pair corresponds to a
longer duration than the epoch, the time is truncated down to match the
epoch's duration. Presently, the base type to duration mapping is arbitrary.
