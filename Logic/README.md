## Functorial Logic

This library is an exercise in developing logic from the perspective of
an ajoint situation:

竏パ, 竏p :: P(X x Y) -> P(X) and ()* :: P(X) -> P(X x Y), 竏パ |- p* |- 竏p


### Future Directions
- Extend to non-Boolean Toposes, for instance, category of irreflexive graphs.
  - Define relevant power object or explict Truth object.

- Develop classical propositional logic via product construction. See 6.6 of
Marquis below, page 224.
  - 竏ペT(x,y) = 竏パT = { x 撩 X | 竏ペ(x,y) 撩 T }

- Consider unboxed Vectors and more efficient data structures (BTrees perhaps)
for calculating inverse images.

- Rely on laziness, evaluate only when necessary.
