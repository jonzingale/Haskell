  Here are some calculations for how
  quickly the good paths fall off. Less than 1% by n == 49
  
  It is also worthwile to note:
  Calculating a waiting times problem for when the first
  12 or 21 pair is likely to happen gives a reasonable
  estimate for why the tree algorithm should do well
  as the length of a string goes to infinity.

Integrating on my TI-85 from 0 to 20
gives 5.7027, which is only negligibly
better than from 0 to 3
